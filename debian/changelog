readsb (3.7.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * dump1090: Fix Rc decoding errors
  * dump1090: Compute ADS-B v0 NACp/SIL
  * dump1090: When generating aircraft.json, leave space for the final line;
    otherwise the generated json may have trailing garbage
  * dump1090: Don't update the known-address-set from DF18 messages
  * Skyview: use heading data for icon orientation if track data is unavailable
  * Bail out if rtlsdr_read_async() returns early; it probably means we lost
  * dump1090: Bail out if rtlsdr_read_async() returns early; it probably means we lost
    the USB device. There was a workaround for this (originally implemented
    in dump1090-mutability) that got lost in the refactoring needed to support
    different SDRs. librtlsdr can still be flaky under disconnect conditions, so
    this won't catch everything.
  * dump1090: add ENABLED to /etc/default/readsb
  * dump1090: track FMS and MCP selected altitudes separately
  * skyview: use whichever selected altitude is available
  * faup1090: updates to support PiAware 3.7.0

readsb (3.6.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * fix tracking of NICbaro
  * Don't translate 7x00 to emergency status, it obscures the source of the

readsb (3.3.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Improvements to the Mode A/C demodulator.
  * Automatically enable Mode A/C if a Beast command requesting it is received.
    (disable with --no-modeac-auto)
  * Process the radarcape position message, emit it from faup1090.

  * Updated the FlightAware aircraft data export.
  * Updated the default package-based maximum range to 360NM to match what
    piaware-support configured for sdcard installs.
  * Remove internal webserver code entirely (previously, it was just disabled
    at compile time).
  * Tweak the timing reported for Mode S and Mode A/C messages to match how
    the Beast/Radarcape does it. This affects the interval between Mode S
    and Mode A/C messages only; intervals between Mode S messages and other
    Mode S messages, or A/C and other A/C, are unchanged.

readsb (3.2.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix a stray extra comma in port 30003 output if only GNSS altitude
    was available
  * Track CPR encoding type directly rather than inferring it from airground;
    using airground meant some position messages that should be usable were
    not used

    higher A/C rates without chewing tons of CPU
  * Map: Decrease the maximum marker size shown
  * Map: Show additional datasource information (TIS-B etc) in table mode
  * Map: Move the datablock so it doesn't overlap the zoom control

    to the URL (e.g. for high latency connections)
  * view1090-fa: Use ncurses to reduce flicker on remote connections
  * view1090-fa:  Fix knots -> km/h conversion in interactive mode

    * sidebar is resizeable / hideable
    * table-only (no map) mode
    * improved FlightAware aircraft links
    * configurable units display (metric / imperial / aeronautical)
    * filter displayed aircraft by altitude
    * option to show all aircraft tracks
    * more aircraft markers
    * use aircraft markers based on aircraft type info where available
    * scale marker size based on zoom to avoid overlap when zoomed out
  * Include a greatly expanded aircraft type/registration database (used by the
    map display) based on the publically-distributable parts of FlightAware's
    internal database
  * Try to compute a registration from ICAO address for aircraft where there
    is a predictable mapping (e.g. US N-registrations)
  * Try to coexist with other packages (e.g. dump1090-mutability) that also
    provide a lighttpd config that changes the server.stat-cache-engine setting
  * Serve actual map data on port 8080, not just a redirect
  * Redirect requests for /readsb to /readsb/ rather than 404ing.
